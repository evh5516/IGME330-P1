    -I have moved away from working on integrating Sin wave movement for the moment (possible addition later).
    -Phyllotaxis spawns at center, constantly growing and moving all spawned points, user can currently reverse x direction on click.
    -All directions screen wrap
    -Pause, Play, Stop Movement, Start Movement, Reverse Direction buttons added
    -I plan on adding directional movement to make the formation move as user wishes (similar to snake games)
    -Color changing features coming?
    -Allow for changing speed and/or spacing
    -Need to fix fade so it properly erases after a period of time
